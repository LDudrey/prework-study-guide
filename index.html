        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that work together to create the structure, framework of a webpage. They ARE case-sensitive.
           <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a &lt;body&gt; element, those three nested elements are known as child elements.</li>
           <li>The element that holds all the children elements is known as a parent element.</li>
           <li>Types of elements:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Text elements</li>
            <li>Image elements</li>
            <li>Header elements</li>
            <li>List elements</li>
            <li>Meta-related elements</li>
            <li>Content division elements</li>
            <li>Semantic elements</li>
          </ul> 
           <li>Preceding HTML code is a declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Declarations are NOT case-sensitive. Declaration tells the browser what document type to expect when it is opened.</li>
           <li>The HTML attribute &lt;html lang="en"&gt; tells the browser what language for the webpage.</li>
           <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
           <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains metadata information about the webpage.</li>
           <li>The &lt;meta&gt; element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The meta element &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; defines the character set as UTF-8 which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>
            <li>The meta element &lt;http-equiv&gt; element sets an HTTP header for content.
            <li>The meta element &lt;viewport&gt; element sets the default view of our webpage.</li>
            <li>The &lt;title&gt; element defines the title for a webpage. It is required and extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          </ul>
           <li>The &lt;body&gt; represents the visible content shown to the user. It is an example of a Semantic HTML element.</li>
           <li>Use &lt;h1&gt; headings in order from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</li>
           <li>The &lt;p&gt; represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
           <li>The &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt; elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
           <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. &lt;src&gt; defines the image location</li>
           <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line break or empty space.</li>
           <li>The &lt;a&gt; stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other pages.</li>
           <li>The &lt;style&gt; element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
           <li>The &lt;base&gt; element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
           <li>The &lt;link&gt; element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
           <li>The &lt;script&gt; element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Inline CSS apply styles directly in the HTML file to specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Example:&lt;h1 style="color:red;"&gt;Prework Study Guide&lt;/h1&gt; This changes a single heading to red.</li>
          </ul>
           <li>Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. Rules only apply to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs.</li>
           <li>Most common is External CSS style sheet. This is prefered because it allows developer to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file to make changes easier.</li>
           <li>The &lt;link&gt; element creates the connection to the exernal file.</li>
           <li>To link an external CSS sheet add &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"&gt; element after the final meta element and before title element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relation ship between the current ocument and the linked document resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location URL of the external resource. This href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is dervied from the current location (index.html). We must lookin the assets folder to locate.</li>
          </ul>
           <li>CSS box model refers to each HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside, padding and content.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          </ul>
           <li>To help us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code. We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
           <li>The text-align is a way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
           <li>The &lt;img&gt; selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
           <li>The .card selector contains width, margin, border and box-shadow properties.</li>
           <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class with gain these property assignments.</li>
           <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done by semantic references such as gray or blue.</li>
           <li>Color can also be added by its hexadecimal code or hex #.</li>

           <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
           <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
           <li>cd: change directory, navigates through the directory
           <li>cd ..: navigates backwards through the directory one level at a time</li>
           <li>ls: displays a list of files and folders in current directory</li>
           <li>pwd: displays the current working directory</li>
           <li>mkdir: make directory, creates a new directory</li>
           <li>start: opens a file Ex: start first-day.txt</li>
           <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>You link the .js file under the &lt;footer&gt; element within the &lt;body&gt; on the html page.</li>
        <ul>
           <li> Ex: &lt;script src="./assets/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
        </ul>
           <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is read from top to bottom.</li>
           <li>Each line of code ends with a semicolon.</li>
           <li>Strings are contained in quotation marks.</li>
           <li>A variable (var) is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. After the var keyword we give the variable a name.</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Ex: var shape</li>
        </ul>
           <li>= is an assignment operator to assign specific data we store in our variable.</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Ex: var shape = "circle";</li>
        </ul>
           <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Data is typically related in some way.</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Ex: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
        </ul>
           <li>Another Array example: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Only student name is in quotations because it is a string</li>
            <li>54 is a number and does not need quotations</li>
            <li>true is a Boolean value, no quotations needed.</li>
        </ul>

           <li>if and else if statements are a way of creating a conditional statement in JavaScript.</li>
           <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN or a Boolean data type with false value.</li>
           <li>A value is considered truthy if all other values including Boolean are true.</li>
           <li>for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
